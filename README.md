# <professional-portfolio>

## Description

I built this webpage as a way for me to organize my projects, resume, and contact information in one place for future employers. It solves the problem of sending possible employers multiple links, where if I sent them this they could have everything in a consise format that shows my skillset.

## Usage

The nav bar at the top allows the user to navigate between sections of the page, the boxes are links to the corresponding section. In the Projects section, the project preview images are links to projects. Since I dont have many projects yet, only one of them is a working link with the others serving as placeholders. Beneith the pojects section, there is a resume section with a link to my resume (I do not have a resume yet so this is also a placeholder). Finally, the contact section has links in the form of the corresponding website logos. Click on them to visit my profile, again, only the github is a working link as I do not yet have a linkedin, indeed, etc...
